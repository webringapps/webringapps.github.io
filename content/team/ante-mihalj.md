  intro: >-
    Hi, my name is Ante, I am a software engineer with 15-year experience in software industry. My experience includes successful team leadership combined with understanding complex business domains and delivering them into practice. I have worked with lot of technologies during my working experience and I am not afraid to take challenges, learn new things and adopt. I value hard work, team spirit and search for knowledge. I have made a full circle from "Hello worlds", building enterprise architectures, programming and designing software, playing lead dev roles in few startups (both back and front end) to client consultancy and team education.
    
  content: >-
    I have started with __software development__ during my college, working with __Java__ and __.NET__ desktop frameworks. Java was still young, so was C#. Everything was Object Oriented except when I had to work with Javascript. At that time it was really Vanilla. Learning new programming languages and self-improvement were my daily basis.


    After my graduation I headed into banking IT industry, learning enterprise-level skills and technologies - IBM, Java enterprise, Websphere etc. Worked mostly with Java, seen transitions from __Java EJB__ 2 to 3. I learned a lot about that world, enterprise software and banking in general. But after few years I just couldn't keep myself out of that dynamic IT world that was outside tall banking walls. Already I have started working on side web projects with some of my college buddies, __building websites and integrating CMS__. Working with front-end and design was a countermeasure for all that banking strict world and gave me a way to express my __design skills__.


    I decided to leave banking world and try out new startup world.I have had few startup projects behind me, worked on them as the lead dev or a consultant. Most of them were __Microsoft technology__ based - building APIs on __Microsoft MVC or WebAPI__, using __Microsoft SQLServer__ in the background and building __Single Page App__ in frontend with __jQuery or Angular__. One of them had a real success, you may see what it is about [Repsly](http://www.repsly.com) or Budgeteer. The other startup  was in satellite industry, I worked on a SPA that is dashboard for ground station control center (Angular, NodeJS, Java)



    Also I spent few years doing __consultancy and development for Salesforce.com__ development based company in the UK. Salesforce.com is the __biggest cloud-based CRM platform__ and client company delivers packages and products built on that platform. Along with consulting I have worked days and nights with a dev team to deliver cloud-based e-commerce API system hosted on __Heroku__ that integrates with Salesforce and supports scalability. If you have ever worked with Salesforce, then you know what I am talking about. Salesforce limitations are one hard place between you and that rock that keeps bashing your projects.


    Currently, I am working as a __freelancer__ through my freelance agency [We Bring Apps](http://www.webringapps.com) as a __Principal technical consultant__, __senior developer__, working and educating a team of developers on collaborate projects or working as a software architect/consultant on projects. The team provides various development services and you can contact us if you need a __team of highly qualified software engineers__.
